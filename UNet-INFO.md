## UNet Model for Road Detection

The UNet model is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) designed specifically for image segmentation tasks. It was originally developed for biomedical image segmentation, but its architecture is versatile and can be applied to various segmentation problems, including road detection. In this project, we use a UNet model to detect drivable areas in road images by generating binary segmentation masks.

### Model Architecture

The UNet architecture consists of two main parts: the contracting (encoder) path and the expansive (decoder) path. The encoder path captures context and features from the input image, while the decoder path reconstructs the segmentation mask from these features. The key innovation of UNet is the use of skip connections, which connect corresponding layers in the encoder and decoder paths to preserve spatial information.

#### Contracting Path (Encoder)

The contracting path is composed of a series of convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers. Each convolutional layer consists of two convolution operations, each followed by a ReLU activation function and batch normalization. The max-pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, effectively downsampling the input image and capturing context.

#### Expansive Path (Decoder)

The expansive path is composed of a series of transposed convolutional layers (upsampling) followed by convolutional layers. Each transposed convolutional layer increases the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, effectively upsampling the input image. The skip connections from the encoder path are concatenated with the upsampled feature maps, allowing the model to retain spatial information that may have been lost during downsampling.

#### Skip Connections

Skip connections are a key component of the UNet architecture. They link corresponding layers in the encoder and decoder paths, allowing the decoder to access high-resolution features from the encoder. This helps the model produce more accurate and detailed segmentation masks.

### Loss Functions

Two loss functions are used to train the model:
1. **Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) Loss:** Measures the binary cross-entropy between the predicted segmentation mask and the ground truth mask. It is effective for binary classification tasks.
2. **Dice Loss:** Measures the overlap between the predicted segmentation mask and the ground truth mask. It is particularly useful for imbalanced datasets where the foreground (drivable area) is much smaller than the background.

The final loss used for training is the sum of BCE loss and Dice loss, ensuring that both pixel-wise accuracy and segmentation quality are optimized.

### Inference

During inference, the input image is preprocessed (resized, normalized) and passed through the model to generate a probability map. The probability map is then thresholded to produce a binary segmentation mask, which is resized to the original image size. The drivable area in the binary mask is highlighted in green and superimposed on the original image for visualization.

### Summary

The UNet model used in this project is a powerful and flexible architecture for road detection and other image segmentation tasks. Its ability to capture both local and global context, combined with the use of skip connections, makes it well-suited for generating accurate segmentation masks. By combining BCE loss and Dice loss, the model is trained to produce high-quality segmentation results even in challenging scenarios.
